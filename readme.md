# React Todo using ES6 Classes

This is an implementation of my [React Todo app](https://github.com/reubenberghan/react-todo) using the ES6 class syntax to build the React components.

## Todo List

- [ ] Clean up code removing unnecessary commented code and replace `require()` with `import`
- [ ] Add functionality to create user so users without a GitHub account can use app
